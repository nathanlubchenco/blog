## Seveneves
This was an excellent book, definitely my favorite of the trip so far. <span class="marginnote">Consider this amazing first sentence, which I consider not a spoiler because its literally the first sentence: THE MOON BLEW UP WITHOUT WARNING AND FOR NO APPARENT reason.</span> 
One of the things that I really appreciated about *Seveneves* is that I feel like a lesser author would have attempted to add some filler into each part and ended up with a sort of bloated trilogy. Its still a long read, but its scope demands it.  Part 3 dragged a bit for me, but parts 1 and 2 are good enough to outweigh that.  I think it also has appeal beyond folks just interested in sci-fi, but I'm probably not the best judge of that.


## The Water Knife
This was too grim for me to fully enjoy.  But the concept is really interesting and the story is a compelling and well told quick read.  The setting is sometime in the not too distant future when water shortage in the western US becomes a apocolyptic level problem. If you don't mind or enjoy watching Game of Thrones, then the grimness won't be an issue for you and its probably worth a read, otherwise you should pass.  

## Non-fiction
The difficulty of just living in this climate has slowed down my non-fiction pursuits.  So, I haven't yet acquired that book on NLP.  Instead, I started Jon Kabat-Zinn's *Coming to Our Senses*. A bit lighter all things considered.  Practicing mindfulness meditation has been a positive influence in my life and deepening my understanding seemed like a good direction to head when I'm not entranced in other fantatistical realms.
