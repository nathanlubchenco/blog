Finished reading Greg Egan's Diaspora.  This was an incredibly abstract book.  In fact, I feel like i need a word thats more abstract than abstract.  It was also a bit slow in a number of places.

That being said, there were some really interesting ideas afoot here. I think I enjoyed it more than most people would, so its probably a 3.5 or 4 out of 5 for meand i'd probably downgrade as a recommendation for others to a 3.

Also, started reading:

Introductory Graph Theory by Gary Chartrand

Which yes, is a textbook, but its really refreshing to read a straight foward introduction to an interesting mathematical topic.  One of my knowledge goals is to learn more about graphs and there applications and this was the first recommendation of a certain graph nerd I know.

and

The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfus

A compelling couple of first chapters, a nice change up from abstract sci-fi to fantasy that hasn't sub-genred itself yet.
