Greatly enjoyed reading the Name of the Wind.  Many times fantasy novels are so epic in scope that things can get confusing and muddled.  Rather than following a huge cast of characters, this book focuses on the story of a single one.  
+ Interesting Magic
+ A bit too teenage boy angsty for me 
+ Main character is a narcisist's narcisist, so that could be off putting
+ Looking forward to reading the next one

Just started Seveneves by Neal Stephenson which is off to a tremendoust start. Only an abysmal turn for the worst would make me unlikely to recommend this. 

Considering getting: Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing by Manning and Schuetze 
(any recommendations for / cautions against or preferred resources for getting up to speed on NLP?)

I had thought that I was only going to read fiction on the trip, but that clearly was a miscalculation and one that i'm happy for.
